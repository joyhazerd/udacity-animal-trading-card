**Project Rubric**

**Section 1 - Design**
-The page resembles the card from a design prototype.
-The text is italicized for the animal’s interesting fact.
-The labels are bolded for the animal’s list items.
-The dots are removed from the animal's list items.
-The page has a border around the animal’s name, image, and information (interesting fact, list items, and description).
-The page uses spacing between the animal’s name, image, and information.
-Card width should be fixed and include the spacing around the image (Since the image is 300px wide, the card should be 300px + spacing on either side. Card should not expand with the browser window).
-Feel free to customize your information and styles so long as you follow the above rules. For inspiration, you can try playing around with background colors or border-radius!

**Criteria - Custom Image and Text**
-The placeholder image and information is replaced with favorite animal image and information.
-The image is 300px wide or the image's width is set to 300px.
-The image’s alt is relevant to the animal used.

**Section 2 - Code Quality**
-The HTML includes classes that are used for styling.
-CSS Classes are given meaningful names.
-The student separates HTML from CSS by linking to the stylesheet.
-HTML code does not include <style> elements or style attributes in the body.
-Code is ready for review, meaning new lines and indentation are used for easy readability.
